### Hi, I'm Durval ðŸ‘‹

A project manager, senior full-stack developer (web & mobile), entrepreneur and a personal development mentor. I'm currently directing most of my energy as CEO of [Bigu](http://bigu.digital) (@bigudigital - a software house based in Brazil) and as CTO of [iKEG](https://ikeg.com.br). With a major in Computer Science and a (in progress) Master Degree in Informatics, i've been focusing my projects in customized smart solutions & systems, using mobile and web technologies.

Expert in project and team management, my career migrated to positions of leadership and corporate management roles, acting mainly as CTO at successful startups and companies. Working/worked with major companies, like: Samsung, EPSON, BlackBerry, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, ItaÃº, Danone and other sharks. At the public sphere, I advise institutions in processes improvements through the application of innovation and disruptive technologies, as well as agile methods. Also, I continuously work in project partnerships with international institutions & organizations, such as Universidade de Coimbra (Portugal) and Songs for Smiles Inc. (New York - USA).
