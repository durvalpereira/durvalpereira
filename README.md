### Hi, I'm Durval ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer scientist specialized in software engineering, with a focus in developing customized smart solutions and systems, using mobile and web technologies. Being a serial entrepreneur as well, I've participated and contributed with +10 business and spin-offs, acting also as a mentor for small business and freelancers.

Expert in project and team management, I've built my career with proactive involvements in positions from where I could contribute as much as possible, reaching leadership and corporate management roles, acting mainly as CTO at successful award-winners startups and as Tech Lead in USA/Euro based companies.

I also advise public and private institutions targeting processes improvements through the application of innovation and disruptive technologies, as well as agile methods. I've worked with major companies, like: Samsung, EPSON, BlackBerry, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, ItaÃº, Danone, Disney, Peugeot, Toyota and other sharks.

I was also able to execute and maintain projects, researches and partnerships with international institutions & organizations, such as Universidade de Coimbra (Portugal) and Songs for Smiles Inc. (New York - USA).
